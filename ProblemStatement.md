## REST API Implementation With OAuth

You have to complete the work using the SpringBoot framework and Java language. The code does not need to handle all types of errors, but there should be some basic error handling.

### Requirements
This assignment aims to integrate (or consume) with the public API and perform operations.

### You are required to create 3 APIs as follows.

All the 3 APIs created will be protected by OAuth, and no unauthorized access should be allowed. Designing an authentication mechanism that will authenticate and generate an OAuth or JWT token for accessing the 3 APIs is a must.
